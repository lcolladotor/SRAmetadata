.Failing this attempt.. Failing the application.. Cloned, deleted first step, halved number of concurrent reducers (from 32 to 16 per node) in second step with "-D mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb= 3328 -D mapreduce.reduce.java.opts=-Xmx2662m", deleted any incomplete output of second step on S3 (the dir s3://rail-eu-west-1/sra_batch_23_sample_size_500_itn.intermediate), and resumed.
